Overview:
This project is designed to learn how to work with JavaScript and html. 
Summary 
While working with the JavaScript web application the “Drawback” to the provided data 
is in the back-end. It seems like most of the data is older. 
A future “update” may include an option to scrape sources for more up-to-date information. 
Other options would be to clean up the look of the website. Maybe add options for better images and art work.
