# UFOs

## Overview:

This project is designed to learn how to work with JavaScript and html. 

## Summary 

While working with the JavaScript web application the “Drawback” to the provided data 
is in the back-end. It seems like most of the data is older. 

A future “update” may include an option to scrape sources for more up-to-date information. 
Other options would be to clean up the look of the website. Maybe add options for better images and art work.
